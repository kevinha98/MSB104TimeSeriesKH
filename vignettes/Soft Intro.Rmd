# Introduction

“Seriously, it doesn’t have to be about sharing your code (although that is an added benefit!). It is about saving yourself time.” Organising code in a package makes your life easier because packages come with conventions.
> [Hilary Parker (2014)](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)

# 1. Creating a package

## Before inititating the package

**System setup**

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2","usethis",
"rstudioapi", "testthat", "knitr", "available", "pgkdown","purrr"))
```

**For running this presentation**
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages(c("xaringan"))
devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/xaringanExtra")
```

---

There are three formal requirements:

- The name can only consist of letters, numbers, and period. Must not start with a number
- It must start with a letter
- It cannot end with a period

- Pakkenavn:
  - MSB104TimeSeries&lt;your_init&gt;
    
---

**RStudio IDE** (option A)

File -> New Project -> New Directory -> R package
![](bilder/packagecreate.png) 

---

**Console** (option B)

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
package_name <- 'MSB104TimeSeries<YourInit>'
usethis::create_package(package_name, rstudio=T, open=T)
```

---

# 2. Publishing the package to a repository 

```{bash eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git init --initial-branch=main
git add --all
git commit -m "first commit"
```

Now, for either of the options
1. Go to your own [github](https://github.com) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com) account
1. Create a new project (public) with the same name: MSB104TimeSeries&lt;your_init&gt;  

1. After that, run the following commands from your RStudio terminal

```{bash eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
a) Github
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_github_account>/MSB104TimeSeries<your_init>.git
b) Gitlab
git remote add origin https://gilab.com/<your_github_account>/MSB104TimeSeries<your_init>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

# 3. Overview of the different package components

In general consist of:

- Code (R/)
- Package metadata (DESCRIPTION)
- Object documentation (man/)
- Vignettes (vignettes/)
- Testing (tests/)
- Namespaces (NAMESPACE)
- Data (data/)
- Compiled code (src/)
- Installed files (inst/)
- Other components

Note: In addition to this, we have also the option to create our own folders

---

Let's us now first have a closer look at some of these general components:

- Code (R/)
- Namespaces (NAMESPACE)
- Package metadata (DESCRIPTION)
- Object documentation (man/)
- Data (data/)
- Namespaces (NAMESPACE)

---

## Code (R/)

The first principle of using a package is that all R code goes in R/.

We can open our hello function directly from the console by using
- usethis::use_r("hello")

Which gives us

```{r}
hello <- function() {
	  print("Hello, world! My name is <insert your name here> ")
}
```

Change this to

```{r}
#' This is a hello function with a name argument
#' @export
hello <- function(name=NULL) {
          tekst <- paste("Hello world! My name is", name)
	  print(tekst)
}
```

---

## Namespaces (NAMESPACE)

Namespaces make your packages self-contained in two ways: the imports and the exports. The imports defines how a function in one package finds a function in another.

The exports helps you avoid conflicts with other packages by specifying which functions are available outside of your package (internal functions are available only within your package and can’t easily be used by another package). 

---

### With RStudio IDE

- Add roxygen comments to your .R files.
  - Roxygen comments start with #' and come before a function. All the roxygen lines preceding a function are called a block. Each line should be wrapped in the same way as your code, normally at 80 characters.

- To make it simple in the beginning, we just add a couple of lines:

```{r, eval=F, include=T}
#' This is a hello function with a name argument
#' @export
hello <- function(name=NULL) {
          tekst <- paste("Hello world! My name is", name)
	  print(tekst)
}
```

---

## (1) Building (2) installing and (3) loading a package

- Building and installing

2a. Option A (IDE)
	- Install Package: 'Ctrl + Shift + B'
	- MSB104TimeSeries<your_init>::hello()

2b. Option B (Console)
1. devtools::document()
1. devtools::install()
1. MSB104TimeSeries&lt;your_init&gt;::hello(<your_init>)
A built package can be found in one of these paths

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

---

- Loading

```{r, eval=F}
library(MMSB104TimeSeries<your_init>)
### Package consists of the following functions
ls(package:MMSB104TimeSeries<your_init>)
```

[Package development (cheat sheet)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/package-development.pdf)

---

## Package metadata (DESCRIPTION)

The job of the DESCRIPTION file is to store important metadata about your package

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
Package: MSB104TimeSeriesJIH
Title: For the time series part of the MSB104 course in econometrics
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Jørn I.",
           family = "Halvorsen",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "jiha@hvl.no",
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID"))
Description: What the package does (one paragraph).
License: `use_mit_license()`, `use_gpl3_license()` or friends to pick a
    license
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```

---

## Object documentation (man/)

Documentation is one of the most important aspects of a good package. 

- Without it users won’t know how to use your package. 
- Documentation is also useful for future-you (so you remember what your functions were supposed to do)
- For developers extending your package.

---

## Data (data/)

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
usethis::use_data_raw()
file.edit("data-raw/hello_world_data.R")
```

- Change the DATASET.R file to
```{r, eval=F}
## code to prepare `DATASET` dataset goes here
hw_iris <- iris
usethis::use_data(hw_iris, overwrite = TRUE)
```
- Source the code
- (1) Build, (2) install and (3) load the package
- Run data(package='MSB104TimeSeries<your_init>')

- You could also try out the data() function

---

## Some other componnents

### Testing (tests/)

Testing is a vital part of package development. 
+ It ensures that your code does what you want it to do. 
- Testing, however, adds an additional step to your development workflow.

"I started using automated tests because I discovered I was spending too much time re-fixing bugs that I’d already fixed before."
> Hadley (2015)
---

### Installed files (inst/)

When a package is built, everything in inst/ is copied into the top-level package directory.

You are free to put anything you like in inst/ with one caution: subdirectory with the same name as an existing directory. 

- inst/extdata: additional external data for examples and vignettes. See external data for more details
- inst/java, 
- inst/python etc. See other languages.

For MSB104TimeSeriesJIH you will find the Rmd code for this xaringan-presentation in
- inst/docs/package_presentationJIH.Rmd

Check if you are able to download this package in comple the presentation on your own computer.

```
### vignettes (vignettes/)
Many existing packages have vignettes. 
- You can see all the installed vignettes with
```{r, eval=F, include=T}
vign <- browseVignettes(all=T) 
names(vign)
```

- To see the vignette for a specific package, use the argument

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
browseVignettes("dplyr")
```

- To make your own vignette

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
usethis::use_vignette("application1_hello_world")
```

---

### Compiled code (src/)

R is a high-level, expressive language. But that expressivity comes at a price: speed. That’s why incorporating a low-level, compiled language like C or C++ can powerfully complement your R code. While C and C++ often require more lines of code (and more careful thought) to solve the same problem, they can be orders of magnitude faster than R.

---

# 4. Build websites for your R-package

## Configuration and building

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
### Run once to configure your package to use pkgdown
usethis::use_pkgdown()
## Run to build the website
pkgdown::build_site()
```

---

## Deploying the webpage

1. Commit and push your changes to the remote (note: make sure that docs is not included in the .gitignore file)
1. Login on to [github](https://github.com) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com) account, navigate to your repo and select “Settings”.
1. Scroll down to find the “Git Hub pages” subsection and, under “Source”, select “master branch/docs folder” (from this, you can see that it is fundamental that your website material is pushed to the master branch)
1. click on the link of your website and… congratulations: you just published your new pkgdown website !

---
